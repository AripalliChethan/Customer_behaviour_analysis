# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using PYTHON, MYSQL And POWERBI)

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

--> Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

--> Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

--> Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/AripalliChethan/Customer_behaviour_analysis/blob/main/customer_shopping_behavior.csv">DataSet</a>

--> Analysis in Python<a href="https://github.com/AripalliChethan/Customer_behaviour_analysis/blob/main/Customer_Shoppingbehaviour.ipynb">View Data in Python</a>

--> Analysis in Sql<a href="https://github.com/AripalliChethan/Customer_behaviour_analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Shopping%20Behaviour%20Analysis.sql.sql">View Data operations on SQL</a>

--> Dashboard in PowerBI <a href="https://github.com/AripalliChethan/Customer_behaviour_analysis/blob/main/Customer%20behaviour%20dashboard.pbix">View DashBoard in PowerBI</a>

## Process

--> Opened the Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb notebook to begin the workflow, which included data import, initial exploration, cleaning, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

-->Conducted detailed data exploration to understand customer demographics, purchase patterns, and key behavioral trends.

--> Cleaned and transformed the dataset by handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and standardizing formats to ensure reliable downstream analysis.

--> Established a connection from Python to a MySQL database for structured storage and advanced querying.

--> Created a new database in SQL and executed Python scripts to load the cleaned dataset into SQL tables.

--> Opened and utilized the customer_behavior_analysis.sql file to run analytical queries and answer key business questions related to customer behavior, spending patterns, and product preferences.

--> Connected the SQL database to Power BI to enable seamless visualization and reporting.

--> Opened the customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix file and developed an interactive dashboard with KPIs, trend charts, filters, and slicers to visually present actionable insights derived from the SQL analysis.

 ## Project Insights

-> Clothing leads both revenue and sales volume, generating approximately $18K, making it the top-performing category. It significantly outperforms Footwear and Outerwear, indicating a clear customer preference. This suggests that increasing inventory, promotions, and seasonal campaigns for Clothing could further boost overall revenue.

-> Only 29% of customers are subscribers, yet they contribute noticeably to overall value. With 70% being non-subscribers, there is a major opportunity to grow the subscription base through targeted offers, personalized benefits, and awareness campaigns.

-> Middle-aged and Senior customers are the highest revenue contributors, forming the core purchasing demographic. Their stronger spending capacity makes them ideal targets for loyalty rewards, premium product recommendations, and personalized marketing.

-> The average purchase amount is $60.47, indicating that customers typically buy moderately priced items. This presents a clear opportunity to increase average order value through product bundling, upselling premium variants, or offering limited-time discounts.

-> Shopping behavior patterns suggest that Express and Standard delivery options influence customer purchases. Higher-spending age groups (Middle-aged and Senior) show consistent order frequency and revenue, indicating that optimizing shipping benefits for these groups could further enhance sales and satisfaction.

## Final Conclusion
The analysis shows that Clothing is the strongest revenue driver, supported by high engagement from Middle-aged and Senior customers. Although only a small portion of users are subscribers, they offer strong growth potential through targeted promotions. The average purchase value indicates space for upselling and bundling strategies. Overall, optimizing inventory, subscription programs, and personalized marketing can significantly enhance business performance.
